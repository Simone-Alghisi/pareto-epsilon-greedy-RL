#### Few notes on data normality #####
# How to Handle Non-Normal Data
#
# If a given dataset is not normally distributed, we can often perform one of the following transformations to make it more normally distributed:
#
# 1. Log Transformation: Transform the values from x to log(x).
#
# 2. Square Root Transformation: Transform the values from x to âˆšx.
#
# 3. Cube Root Transformation: Transform the values from x to x1/3.
#
# By performing these transformations, the dataset typically becomes more normally distributed.
# Read this tutorial to see how to perform these transformations in R.
